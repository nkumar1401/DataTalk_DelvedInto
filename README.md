
🚀 DataTalk: The Future of Autonomous Data Intelligence
Founder: Nirmal Kumar Bhagatkar

Vision: Solving world problems by automating data science and dignifying human labor through advanced AI.

🛠️ Project Overview
DataTalk is a professional-grade AI/ML capstone project designed to democratize data science. It allows non-technical stakeholders to perform complex data analysis through natural language.

By integrating a Multi-LLM Failover Architecture (Gemini + Groq), the system ensures high availability and lightning-fast inference, capable of handling large-scale business datasets.

✨ Key Features
Intelligent Data Acquisition: Automated fetchers for Scikit-learn, Raw URLs, and Local uploads.

Architecture-Level Cleaning: Automated missing value imputation and IQR-based outlier detection.

Autonomous Visualization: Instant Plotly charts generated via AI-driven Python execution.

Failover Resilience: Primary processing via Gemini 2.0 with a high-speed fallback to Groq (Llama-3).

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone & Setup Environment
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataTalk.git
cd DataTalk
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Or myenv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configure Secrets
Create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file and add your credentials:

Ini, TOML

GENAI_API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_key"
groq_API_KEY = "your_groq_key"
3. Run the Intelligence Engine
Bash

streamlit run Home.py
🛡️ Technical Implementation Note
DataTalk uses a Resilient Execution Engine. Python code generated by the LLM is captured via Regex and executed in a sandboxed namespace to ensure data privacy and system security.

🌎 Vision & Future
My goal is to evolve DataTalk into a global AI firm that minimizes human workload by 90%, allowing the human race to focus on creativity and higher-level problem solving. This project is the first step toward building a trillion-dollar legacy in the AI/ML industry.
